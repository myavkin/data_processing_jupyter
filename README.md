# Sample data processing Jupyter Notebook (& Python) module

Data processing sample implementation of a Simple Linear Regression with elementary visualisation. As per requirements, the processing data should not have any PII or commercial info. While there is a wide variety of open data sources it is going to be time consuming to analyse and understand the dependencies as well as defining "business" need to demonstrate any ML algorithms.

# Objective:
	Demonstrate a concise piece of work with data processing code, exploratory code, data visualisation code, modelling dataset prep code, test code.

# Data scope:
	  A snapshot of Personal expenses for a period of 72 months. 
    
# Purpose: 
	Apply ML Simple Linear Regression model to predict future Expenses based on Income. 
  
# Usage
1.	Check out the following files:

		  data_processing_jupyter/notebook-strt.ipynb
		  data_processing_jupyter/raw-data/all-ops-2006-2013-extract-2.csv
      
2.	Open the notebook-strt.ipynb in VisualStudio Code or any alternative jupyter tool

3.	Use package downloader/installer of such packages as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, warnings and sklearn. E.g.:
    
      pip install numpy

4.	Execute the Notebook from the very beginning
5.	Review results
